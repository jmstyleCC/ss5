# About
***
A really simple, yet not very standard compilant, SOCKS5 server in C for IPv4.

# Todo
***
- Port to win32.
- Fix up the domain lookup.
- Make talk() more customizable.
- Add threading to talk_wrapper().

# Building
***
This is real simple. Just `make` and it should be alright on any POSIX platform. Tested only on linux, though.
